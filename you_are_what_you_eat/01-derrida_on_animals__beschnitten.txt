The question of the animal comes up in all of my texts
since the very beginning.


It addresses certain sensitive points                  ,
the definition of what is proper to man,
and what distinguishes man from animals in general.


I avoid speaking generally about animals.
For me, there are not 'animals.'
When one says, 'animals,' one has already started to not understand anything,
and has started to enclose the animal into a cage.
There are considerable differences between different types of animals.
There is no reason one should group into one and the same category
monkeys, bees, snakes, dogs, horses,
anthropods and microbes.
These are radically different organisms of life,
and to say, 'animal,'
and put them all into one category―
both the monkey and the ant―
is a very violent gesture.
To put all living things that aren't human into one category
is, first of all, a stupid gesture―theoretically ridiculous―
and partakes in the very real violence that humans exercise towards animals.
That leads to slaughterhouses,
their industrial treatment,
their consumption.
All this violence towards animals
is engendered in this conceptual simplification
